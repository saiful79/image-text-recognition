# [How to train a Keras model to recognize text with variable length](https://www.dlology.com/blog/how-to-train-a-keras-model-to-recognize-variable-length-text/)


## How to Run
The easies way is to run on [this Google Colab notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CdB9rvImJCAl_U9yYVD6HqMFWup_RzpG/view?usp=sharing) for free with GPU enabled.
## Alternatively run on your local dev machine
It is suggested to run on a Linux machine since it could be quite challenging to install the dependencies `cairocffi`, or if you only have a Windows machine, running on its [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is also a good choice.

Require [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe) and [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installed
